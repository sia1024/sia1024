Welcome!

I am a PhD student at the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics](https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de) and Bonn International Graduate School of Mathematics since late 2023. My supervisor is [Ursula Hamenst√§dt](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/ursula/). I did my BSc and MSc at the HSE University and Skoltech in Moscow, where I worked under the supervision of [Alexander Gaifullin](https://faculty.skoltech.ru/people/alexandergaifullin).

My current research interests lie within the domains of low-dimensional topology and geometric group theory. I mostly study surface mapping class groups with focus on its homology and representations. I am also interested in some combinatorial problems.

Feel free to contact me!
